     <h2><u>About of Shoshi Lodge</u></h2>
    <pre font-size="6">
        
        Located in the heart of Mymensingh city, the 200-year-old Shoshi Lodge is proud of the identity of a royal family. Knowing the history, it would seem that someone had a grudge against this dynasty. However, the magnificent construction style of this picturesque palace built on 9 acres of land is not the imperfection of this royal family, it is symptomatic of their nobility. <br>
        The first builder of this palace was Suryakanta Acharya Chowdhury, the zamindar (landlord) of Muktagacha. The history of his heredity shows that the founder of the then Muktagacha landlord was Sri Krishna Acharya Chowdhury, whose third successor was Raghunandan Acharya Chowdhury. He was childless. <br>
        So he adopted Gaurikanta Acharya Chowdhury. Before his death, Raghunandan handed over all his belongings to his adopted son. However, Gaurikanta Acharya Chowdhury also had no children. Although Gaurikanta died without leaving an heir, his widow Bimala Devi did not give up. He adopted Kashikant. <br>
        In the grand procession, Lakshmi Debi gave a new name to her son- Suryakanta Acharya Chowdhury. In the joke of the Goddess of fate, he too was childless and adopted a son named Shashikanta Acharya Chowdhury to protect the heritage and pride of his kingdom. <br>
        In 1905, his adopted son and later landlord Shashikanta Acharya Chowdhury built this lodge again on the same spot. In 1911, the young zamindar accomplished some more renovations to enhance the beauty of Shoshi Lodge and it has appeared more impeccably. He was the one who brought the marble statue of Venus from Italy and placed it in the middle of the colorful fountain in the garden of the palace. <br>
