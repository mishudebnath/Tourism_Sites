        Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala (alternate: Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala; translation: "Great Teacher of the Arts" Zainul Abedin "Art Gallery")[1] is an art museum in Mymensingh, <br> Established in 1975, it contains the collections of the artist Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin (1914â€“1976). The art gallery was established in Mymensingh as this is where the artist spent his early days. <br> Abedin, a pioneer of the country's modern art movement, created works of art on subject matters such as the Bengal famine of 1943 and the peoples' independence. <br> The museum is located in the area of Shaheeb Quarter Park on the bank of the Old Bramaputra River. <br>

        Each year in December, the gallery authority organizes an anniversary programme that includes a discussion on the life and work of Zainul, as well as a painting competition. <br> While the art gallery does not issue publications, Bangladesh National Museum, which has a collection of 800 Abedin paintings, has issued posters and cards on behalf of the artist. <br> Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala is a branch of the national museum
